# Reebelo Order Management Microservice

## Description

Reebelo case study for order management microservice (Please bear in mind that this is the first time Iâ€™ve used NestJS, so some implementations and design patterns might not be correct.)

## System Design Considerations

Out of scope for this case study, but worth mentioning

- Authentication and Authorizations

- API Rate Limiting
  - Prevent abuse or unintentional overloading for each endpoints.

- Logging and Monitoring

- Service Resilience
  - Implementing retries to calling external services.

- Data Consistency and Integrity
  - What type of database are we using? does it support ACID transactions or distributed locks to ensure data consistency and integrity?

- Versioning
  - How to handle version control?

- Caching
  - Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed data like inventory order customer information?

## API Endpoint Design Considerations

- Create Orders
  - Implement idempotency to handle race condition.
  - Retries for calling external services.
  - Validate customer information.
  - Validate inventory information.

- Update Orders
  - Following the single responsibility principle, i would break down update orders into multiple methods.
    - Update payment information.
    - Update shipping information.
    - Update shipment tracking information.
    - ***I would remove update status endpoint entirely to avoid direct manipulation of the order status, so order status are triggered only by specific business events.
  - Handle order status conflict with order information being updated, or order has been deleted.
  - Trigger update order status when order information changes.
  - Trigger notification service.

- Update Order Status
  - ***I would remove update status endpoint entirely to avoid direct manipulation of the order status, so order status are triggered only by specific business events.
  - Handle race condition when order has been deleted.
  - Allow batch update?
  - Trigger notification service.

- Delete Orders
  - Return http status code 204 after successful deletion, current NestJS returns standard 200 status.
  - Allow batch delete?
  - Implement soft delete to maintain data integrity.
